Monitor and control your LG Air-to-Water Heat Pump directly from Homey — no cloud, no delays. This app communicates locally over Modbus TCP through an RS485-to-TCP gateway, giving you fast, reliable access to your heat pump's data and controls.

What you can do:

- Switch heating/cooling on or off and set operation mode (Heat, Cool, Auto)
- Adjust water target temperature and DHW (hot water) target temperature
- Monitor live temperatures: water outlet, water inlet, outdoor, room, DHW tank, and backup heater
- Track energy usage: electrical power consumption, thermal output, and real-time COP
- View system status: compressor, water pump, defrost cycle, and outdoor unit activity
- Control DHW heating, silent mode, and temperature control method
- Get notified on errors with automatic alarm detection and error codes
- Build automations with flow triggers, conditions, and actions for all key parameters

Requirements:

- LG Air-to-Water Heat Pump with Modbus RTU support
- RS485-to-TCP serial gateway (like Elfin EW-11 or compatible) connected to the heat pump's Modbus port
- Homey Pro with local network access to the gateway
